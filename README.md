=====

After [wondering on twitter what the best HTML5 presentation system was](https://twitter.com/harper/status/272538510349717506), I had a [few](https://twitter.com/maxogden/status/272539403287666689) [people](https://twitter.com/mattdennewitz/status/272543105071337473) mention that [big]() was a solid presentation generator.

However, I wanted to use markdown to curate and handle my presentations and [big](https://github.com/tmcw/big) didn't handle markdown. There was a [fork](https://github.com/mdznr/big) that use markdown. I wanted to keep my content separate for curation purposes, so it didn't work for me.

Instead, I wrote a helper: [big.py](https://github.com/harperreed/bigpy).

#Installation

Get the source:

    git clone https://github.com/harperreed/bigpy.git
    cd bigpy

Using [virtualenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv)
and [mkvirtualenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenvwrapper)
(if you want) set yourself up:

    mkvirtualenv bigpy

Install some dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

#Usage

`$ python big.py --help`

	Usage: big.py [options]

	Options:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  -s SLIDES.md, --slides=SLIDES.md
                        markdown file holding your slides!
	  -c big.css, --css=big.css
                        big stylesheet
	  -j big.js, --js=big.js
                        big javascript
	  -m MODE, --mode=MODE  mode: remote, local[default: remote]
	  -t TEMPLATE_MODE, --template_mode=TEMPLATE_MODE
                        template mode: allinone, light [default: allinone]

###Generate all in one `slide.html` from `slide.md`:

`$ python big.py -s slides.md`

	Attempting to open slide file: slides.md
	Remote css/js selected
	Pulling css from: https://raw.github.com/tmcw/big/gh-pages/big.css
	Pulling js from: https://raw.github.com/tmcw/big/gh-pages/big.js
	Parsing markdown file
		Title: Example Slides
		Author: Harper Reed
		Date: November 24, 2012
		Number of slides: 15
	Allinone template mode
	Writing HTML: slides.html

This will output a `slides.html` that pulls the latest `big.css` and `big.js` from [tmcw/big]() embedded in it.

###Generate all in one `slides.html` from local js/css

`$ python big.py -s slides.md --mode local`

	Attempting to open slide file: slides.md
	Local css/js selected
	Parsing markdown file
		Title: Example Slides
		Author: Harper Reed
		Date: November 24, 2012
		Number of slides: 15
	Allinone template mode
	Writing HTML: slides.html

This will output `slides.html` with a local copy of `big.css` and `big.js` embeded in it.

###Generate `slides.html` calling remote js/css

`$ python big.py -s slides.md --template_mode light`

###Generate allinone `slides.html`

`$ python big.py -s slides.md --template_mode allinone`

**Mix and match to your delight!**

No idea. I don't know if i will use this. I just wanted a way to generate big html with a script. It seemed like it should be easy. It was. Only one movie of hacking.

Feel free to fix things as you need them.

#Thanks
